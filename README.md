# Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict whether a client is eligible for credit card approval or not, which is a common risk management method in the financial industry. The project uses various features such as gender, car ownership, annual income, education level, and occupation type, among others, to make predictions. The data used in the project was downloaded from Kaggle and includes credit history records of clients, including their status (past due, overdue, paid off, or no loan) and months of balance. By analyzing this data and developing a predictive model, the project can assist financial institutions in making informed decisions regarding credit approvals, reducing risks, and maximizing profitability.
